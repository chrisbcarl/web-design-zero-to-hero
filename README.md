## Part I: Learning Website Fundamentals

### Course Outline
1. Introduction to HTML [Example](http://webdesignzerotohero.net/intro-to-html-css/01-html-intro.html):  
   HTML and Google Chrome is like a .docx and Microsoft Word. Google Chrome displays .html files just like how Word displays .docx. HTML is all about tags. Tags are anything that are enclosed in angle brackets like ```<p>Some stuff inside</p>``` to display a paragraph.  
   The tags we will be covering include:  
   * ```<div></div>``` - a divider  
   * ```<span></span>``` - a tag that spans some text  
   * ```<h1></h1>``` - headers  
   * ```<p></p>``` - paragraph  
   * ```<a></a>``` - a clickable link  
   * ```<table></table>```, ```<tr></tr>```, ```<td></td>``` - table, table row, table data  
   * ```<ul></ul>```, ```<ol></ol>```, ```<li></li>``` - unordered lists (bullet points), ordered lists (numbered), and list items  
   * ```<strong></strong>```, ```<em></em>``` - bold and italicize  
   * ```<img></img>``` - images  
   * ```<form></form>```, ```<input></input>```, ```<button></button>``` - allways to create a form
